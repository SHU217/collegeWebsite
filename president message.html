<p>When one looks at past 3 years of journey of Raghuraj Sharan Singh College it is full of achievements and success. with the introduction of new faculties and courses, no one can challenge its academic development, but this is not sufficient progress of any educational cannot be accessed with the subjects, buildings and the number of teachers. It can only be acessed with the institution in the progress of the country, Although we are one of the best institutions of Avadh University (we have sufficient land, buildings, labs, library, playground, comference halls, stadium and trained staff). we will not have satisfaction till the students passing out every year from the college. Contribute to the prosperity, development and security of the country.</p>
<p>We expect our students to face the challenges of time with full courage and bravery and become a good citizen by proper utilization of the available resources and show their talent for the nation's development. This will only be possible when there is a development of awareness for regular attendence, discipline and teamwork, among the college students definitely we will make it an aim and complete it in the coming years.</p>

<p>Today's India is the India of Youths for its complete development, behaviral, creative and mental changes are compulsory.
